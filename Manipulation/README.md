    - This paper deals with manipulator end-effector position control. Simple inverse kinematics and dynamics model of manipulator by Euler-Lagrange method is derived in this paper. A PID controller is proposed to achieve required end-effector position. To reach to one position, a trajectory planning method is used in this paper. By adding constraints for joint position and velocity of the initial and end position, a cubic polynomial is used to interpolate the trajectory of manipulator. Then with desired trajectory, PID controller would force the manipulator to follow the trajectory.
    - A simple example about 2 link arm simulation is introduced in the paper. This example demonstrates that this method can be used for the cases that there is no direct coupling between actuator and joint.
